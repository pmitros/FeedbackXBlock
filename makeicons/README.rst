This is a simple script for generating images of faces for use in the
RateXBlock.

You don't need to use this script yourself; they are committed to the
repo.  The only time you might use this is if changing said icons.

If you do want to use this, run:

  pip install bok_choy
  make

If you'd like to modify the icons, see the HTML file.
